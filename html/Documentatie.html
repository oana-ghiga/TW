      <h3>3.1 Product Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        The Digital Herbarium Website is a university project designed to showcase the potential of online plant
        specimen collections for research and educational purposes. The website will be developed as a standalone
        application, primarily for demonstration purposes, and will not be integrated with any other software systems.

      <h3>3.2 Product Functions</h3>
      <p>
        The website offers a range of functions and features that enable users to interact with the
        plant collection in various ways. Users can create personalized albums for plants, save plants in those
        albums, and add comments for plants. Additionally, users can create an account and log in to access their albums
        and comments from any device. The home page of the web app is composed of a variety of plant photos that
        users can click to reveal detailed descriptions and comment sections for each plant. The system also generates
        thematic albums for users, such as medicinal plants, mountain plants, and others. Users can search plants and
        filter their main page feed based on different categories, such as medicinal plants, mountain plants, and other
        themes. Overall, the system is designed to facilitate the exploration and learning of plant attributes and
        characteristics for users with different levels of expertise and interests.
      </p>
      <h3>3.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        The Digital Herbarium Website is designed to accommodate a variety of user classes with different levels of
        expertise and interests in plants. The primary user classes are students, researchers, and plant enthusiasts.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3.6 User Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        The user will have a user guide on how to use the web application.
      </p>
      <h3>3.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The web application assumes that users have a basic understanding of how to use a web browser and have access
          to an internet connection,
        </li>
        <li>
          The application needs a browser that supports HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS.
